# Introduction
Welcome to the Leary – Ortho Biostats Lab manual. This manual was inspired by other similar works, and borrows heavily from them (e.g., [this one](https://github.com/alylab/labmanual) and [this one](https://github.com/memobc/memolab-manual)). It is intended to represent my vision for how the lab should function and to complement existing University of Missouri policies (which take precedence). We hope you will learn a lot about clinical statistics, developing new skills (coding, analyzing data, writing and giving talks), making new friends and having a great deal of fun throughout the whole process.

This work is licensed under a CC Attribution 4.0 license. We expect that more information will be added and some sections will be revised as the lab grows and develops. If you have any comments or suggestions regarding the contents of this manual, please tell Dr. Leary (leary@health.missouri.edu).

# Lab member expectations and responsibilities
## Everyone
### Big picture
- Do work that you are proud of. 
- Don’t rush your work. Double-check your work and ask others to look at your code or data if you need help or something looks off. 
- Tell your collaborators if you do make a mistake (if they have already seen the results). We admit our mistakes, and then we correct them and move on.
- No academic misconduct. It is never ok to plagiarize, tamper with data, make up data, omit data, or fudge results in any way.
- Be supportive of your lab mates. Share your knowledge and help them out if they need help.
- Work independently when you can, ask for help when you need it.
- Respect each other’s strengths, weaknesses, differences and beliefs.
- Take personal time/ vacation when you need it and cultivate a life outside of the lab. Respect that other lab members also have a life outside of lab.
- Communicate openly and respectfully with other members of the lab. Dr. Leary would rather know more that she needs to know than less. 
- If there is any tension or hostility in the lab, something has to be done about it immediately. If you don’t feel comfortable confronting the person in question, tell Dr. Leary.

### Small picture
- Do not come into the lab if you are sick. Stay home and get healthy, and don't risk getting others sick.
- Notify Ms. Kyeong or Dr. Leary if you will be out, either due to illness or vacation. You need to send an email to Dr. Leary and cc Stacee Clawson and Gigi Harrison. If you are sick and you had experiments or meetings scheduled that day, notify your participants or collaborators and reschedule.
- You aren’t expected to come into lab on weekends and holidays, and you aren’t expected to stay late at night. You are expected to get your work done (whatever time of day you like to do it).
- Show up to your meetings, classes, and exams – just show up for your commitments, and work the hours you need to work to get stuff done.
- Lock the doors if no one else is around, even if you're stepping out for a minute.
- Keep your area tidy. Eating at your desk is fine, but clean up food waste, crumbs, spills. Put equipment back where you found it. Keep common areas uncluttered.
- MOI has a specific dress code, you can check the details at [MOI dress code](#MOI-dress-code). 
- Two trainings (HCUP and IRB) are necessity to be conducted before working. Find detail [here](#Training).

- Be on time. Be on time for your meetings: respect that others have packed days and everyone’s time is valuable.

## Dr. Leary – Principal Investigator
All of the [above](#everyone), plus you can expect her to:
- Maintain a vision of where the lab is going
- Provide the funding necessary to keep the lab going
- Be available in person and via e-mail on a regular basis, including regular meetings to discuss your research (and anything else you’d like to discuss)
- Give you my perspective on academia and issues related to professional development
- Support your career development by introducing you to other researchers in the field, writing recommendation letters for you, providing you with opportunities to attend conferences when possible, and promoting your work in talks
- Care about you as a person and not just a scientist

## Postdocs
All of the [above](#everyone), plus you will be expected to:
- Develop your own independent line of research
- Mentor undergraduate and graduate students on their research projects, when asked or when appropriate
- Apply for external funding.
- Apply for jobs (academic or industry) as soon as you are "ready" and/or by the end of beginning of your second year as a postdoc.
- If you are planning to pursue a non-academic career, treat your postdoctoral research as seriously as you might if you were pursuing an academic career. We can discuss ways of making sure that you are getting the training you need, while still doing excellent research.
- Remind the PI that different scientific opinions can co-exist in the same lab!

## Graduate students (PhD)
All of the [above](#everyone), plus you will be expected to:
- Develop a line of dissertation research. Ideally, your dissertation research will consist of at least 3 experiments that can be packaged into one thesis document.
- Apply for external funding. If nothing else, this is an extremely valuable experience.
- Do some soul-searching as to what type of career you want to pursue, e.g., academic jobs that are research-focused or teaching-focused, non-academic jobs like data science or science writing. We can brainstorm ways of making sure you are getting the training that you need.
- Work with a team of undergraduate students or graduate students more junior than you. This will speed up data collection and give you some experience with managing and mentoring a team.
- Stay up-to-date (and keep up-to-date) on any deadlines that you need to meet to fulfill departmental requirements. This is your responsibility not the PI’s.

## Lab managers
All of the [above](#everyone), plus you will be expected to:
- Maintain the lab IRB protocols and paperwork (e.g., archiving consent forms).
- Oversee the hiring, scheduling, and training of undergraduate and master graduate level research assistants.
- Maintain the lab website.
- Assist other lab members with data collection or analysis (typically you will be assigned to particular projects).
-Maintain databases and grant data requests.
- Help to maintain an atmosphere of professionalism within the lab.
- Work on your own research project.

## Other full-time staff
All of the [above](#everyone), plus you will be expected to:
- Work on your own research project.
- Assist other lab members with data collection or analysis (typically you will be assigned to particular projects).
- Help to maintain an atmosphere of professionalism within the lab.
- Provide extra support to the lab manager and PI.

## Undergraduate students
All of the [above](#everyone), plus you will be expected to:
- Assist other lab members with data collection or analysis (typically you will be assigned to particular projects).
- Work with the lab manager and/or your research mentor to determine your weekly schedule. If you are not able to come in during your normal scheduled time, you must let the lab manager or research mentor know.
- Provide extra support to the lab manager (this may include filing paperwork). If you are in lab and do not have a task to do, you should ask the lab manager or your supervisor whether there is anything you can help out with.
- For more information about undergraduate research positions, refer to the [Undergraduate Research](#Undergraduate-research ) section below.

# Code of conduct
## General
Many topics were covered already in the [Lab member expectations & responsibilities section](#Lab-member-expectations-and-responsibilities).

## Confidentiality Policy
We expect all the lab members to exercise reasonable care in the disclosure, use and management of restricted information about patients, patient care, personnel, students and the fiscal affairs of University of Missouri Health. 

Protected Health Information (PHI)
Patient information is confidential. This includes all patient information, whether in electronic, audio, photo, video or paper form. We expect all lab members to protect and preserve this confidentiality. 

MU Health operates under the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rules and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act. The HIPAA Security Rules require MU Health and our business associates to use administrative, physical and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic protected health information (PHI). 

We do not access, obtain, disclose or discuss PHI without written authorization from patients or their legal representatives, unless necessary for treatment, payment or health care operations, or required by law. We also follow the “Minimum Necessary Rule” which means employees, faculty and staff have the right to access only the patient information necessary to perform our respective jobs. If you have questions regarding access to PHI, please contact the System Privacy Officer at (573) 882-3293. 

## Data Security
We must exercise reasonable care in the disclosure, transmission, access, use and management of confidential information about patients, patient care, personnel, students and proprietary business affairs of University of Missouri Health. 
As stated in the University of Missouri Acceptable Use Policy, electronic information on MU Health networks or equipment, including, but not limited to, electronic mail and personal information, is subject to examination when: 
*	It is necessary to maintain or improve the functioning of our computing resources. 
*	There is suspicion of misconduct under MU Health policies or suspicion of violation of federal or state law. 
*	It is necessary to comply with or verify compliance with federal or state law. 

Protecting confidential information is a priority within our health care system: 
*	Do NOT access patient information unless you need the information to do your job. Inappropriate access to patient information will lead to disciplinary action. 
*	You are to access only the minimum information necessary to accomplish your assigned job duties. This includes all information in paper and electronic form. 
*	Only discuss patient information with authorized personnel and in a private location where unauthorized persons cannot overhear even if you are not using patient names. 
*	Do NOT give information about patients or staff to anyone over the phone.
*	Shred or place confidential information in receptacles specifically used for confidential waste disposal. Never put confidential waste in recycle bins or the regular trash. 
*	The Access and Confidentiality Agreement must be read and signed by all instructors and all lab members. 
Some more information about MU health confidentiality can be found here.


## Lab Notebook Policy
Upon your involvement in research at the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, you will be provided a notebook to aid in your work. Research or lab notebooks are an essential part of doing scientific research. The purpose of this notebook is to have an organized location for you to record and store notes and protocols about the research projects you are involved in through the department. This will help you to keep track of your work and allow you and others to review the steps taken during your analyses.

### Expectations
This notebook:
*	should be labeled with your name and contact information,
*	should be brought to every meeting with Dr. Leary/Ms Kyeong,
*	should be legible and kept in good condition,
*	should contain notes from meetings and a detailed account of the statistical analyses you perform,
*	should be organized and detailed enough for someone else to read and understand what you did,
*	should not contain notes for other courses or projects outside of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery.

### Security
All notebook holders should consider the sensitivity of the information that might be contained within the notebook in order to minimize dissemination of unauthorized information. Due to the sensitive nature of the data that you will be working with, the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery retains the right to confiscate this notebook anytime during or after your involvement with any affiliated research projects. 


## Schedule Notification
For all lab members, your particular work of last week and work schedule for the following week will be discussed and assigned on weekly meeting. 
The lab meeting is obligatory for each member. If you will be absent for some particular reason for the lab meeting, earlier notification needs to be made to Dr. Leary and Ms. Kyeong. For students, the schoolwork is priority, however you need to communicate with your supervisors when your schoolwork conflicts with Lab work and it is necessary to reduce work hours. Any event for personal reason needs to be notified in advance to avoid dispensable planning and scheduling. 


**In addition:**

All members of the lab, along with visitors, are expected to agree with the following code of conduct. We will enforce this code as needed. We expect cooperation from all members to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody. Please also see the University of Missouri NONDISCRIMINATION POLICY.

The lab is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of lab members in any form. Sexual language and imagery are generally not appropriate for any lab venue, including lab meetings, presentations, or discussions. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Dr. Leary immediately. If Dr. Leary is the cause of your concern, then please reach out to Ms. Stacee Clawson, Dr. James Cook or another trusted departmental member who can assist.

We expect members to follow these guidelines at any lab-related event or activity.

## Scientific integrity
### Reproducible research
Reproducible research is research that can be exactly reproduced given the *same* raw data. It is an *essential* part of science, and an expectation for all projects in the lab. Reproducibility is related to replicability, which refers to whether your results can be obtained again with a *different* data set. We expect that all of our research will be replicable, or, at least reproducible.

For results to be reproducible, it requires that you are organized and possess sufficient foresight to document each step of your research process. There are two main things you can do to improve the reproducibility of your research:
- Extensive note-taking. You will need extensive notes on each step of your analysis pipeline, explaining how you did things every step of the way (and the order that you did things), from any pre-processing of the data, to running models, to statistical tests. Your code should also be commented, and commented clearly. Comment your code so that every step is understandable by an outsider. 
- Programming workflows with version control. It is highly encouraged that you use some form of version control (e.g., Git in combination with GitHub) to keep track of what code changes you made and when you made them, as well as sharing code with others.

### Authorship
We will follow NIH guidelines with respect to authorship

>"Authorship credit should reflect the individual's contribution to the study. An author is considered anyone involved with initial research design, data collection and analysis, manuscript drafting, and final approval. However, the following do not necessarily qualify for authorship: providing funding or resources, mentorship, or contributing research but not helping with the publication itself. The primary author assumes responsibility for the publication, making sure that the data are accurate, that all deserving authors have been credited, that all authors have given their approval to the final draft; and handles responses to inquiries after the manuscript is published."

Authorship will be discussed prior to the beginning of a new project, so that expectations are clearly defined. However, changes to authorship may occur over the course of a project if a new person becomes involved or if someone is not fulfilling their planned role. In general, graduate students and postdocs will be first authors on publications on which they are the primary lead, and Dr. Leary will be the last author.

#### Old projects
If a student or post-doc collects a dataset but does not completely analyze it or write it up within 3 years after the end of data collection, Dr. Leary will re-assign the project (if appropriate) to another person to expedite publication. If a student or post-doc voluntarily relinquishes their rights to the project prior to the 3-year window, Dr. Leary will also re-assign the project to another individual. This policy is here to prevent data (especially expensive data, e.g., fMRI) from remaining unpublished, but is meant to give priority to the person who collected the data initially.
## Human subjects research
Adherence to approved IRB protocols is *essential*, and non-adherence can lead to severe consequences for the entire lab. **All lab members must read and comply with the IRB consent form and research summary for any project that they are working on.** If you are not on the IRB, you cannot look at the data, analyze the data, or be in any way involved with the project. Check [here](#training) to see details about the training for IRB.

Lab members must also complete the CITI training and save their certificate. To be added to an existing IRB, talk to the lab manager and present them with your CITI certificate before you can work with human subjects. If there are any questions about the protocols, or if you're not sure whether we have IRB approval to run your study, please ask the lab manager or Dr. Leary for clarification. If necessary, the lab manager can file an amendment to an existing protocol or create a new protocol.

If you encounter any problems in the course of doing research that results in a negative outcome for the participant (e.g., if a participant becomes ill or upset, if there is an accident with the equipment, if there is a breach of confidentiality, etc), you should immediately seek assistance from Dr. Leary or the lab manager. If Dr. Leary is not around, you must notify Dr. Leary and the lab manager *within 24 hours*, preferably as soon as possible. In some cases, we may need to report this information to the IRB and/or our funding agencies.

# Lab Resources
## GitHub
Github is a hosting serveice. Projects on GitHub can be accessed and manipulated using the standard Git command-line interface and all of the standard Git commands work with it. GitHub also allows registered and non-registered users to browse public repositories on the site. All members must register an account in order to contribute to discussion and manage repository. Our lab wiki is also on [Github](https://github.com/LearyE/Ortho-Biostats/wiki). Please check the lab manual and lab wiki if you have any lab related questions. 

## Outlook
Outlook is primarily an email application, it also includes a calendar, task manager, contact manager, note taking, journal, and web browsing.

Tasks can be assigned via Outlook (email), so all members are expected to check emails every day and to response throughout the week as soon as possible.

## Outlook Calendar
Outlook Calendar is within Outlook. It can help to arrange and manage meetings and events. Dr. Leary will send notifications about meeting location and time via Outlook Calendar.

## Box  
Each member will have a BOX folder named by your name. This folder contains all the materials of your projects. 

The projects will have the following folders in each project folder for consistency. You must save each file with the date in the filename using the following format, “yyyymmdd”. For example, if I were saving a report for an ACL project on Aug 10, 2017 it would be saved as “Report_ACLproject_20170810.docx”. It is extremely important that the R code file matches the R workspace file – this is why putting dates in the file names are so important. Never delete old files – they should all have different names (because of the date at the end) and be placed in an “OLD” subfolder, within each project folder 
*	Data – put all Data here, initial data, formatted data, data dictionaries etc. Put all datasets you created in an archive folder so that other members can check the data at anytime.
*	Programs – put all R code here or any other code. You must save your R code each time you revise it. You must annotate all of your R code. It may be years until you need to re-visit a project (or I may need to later on). Annotate your code! 
*	Output – put all calculated tables, figures, and other output here. You must save your R workspace here. 
*	Reports – put all report drafts here as well as any other reporting documents or data. 

## Box Sync
Box Sync is a tool that allows you to mirror data stored on Box to your desktop. You can navigate and modify content stored on the Box website through your computer’s native file browsing interface, without using a web browser. Content that syncs down to your computer is available for offline access, and if you make changes to the synced files locally, these changes automatically sync back up to your Box account. For installing Box Sync, please check [this](https://community.box.com/t5/Using-Box-Sync/tkb-p/UsingBoxSync) if you have problem about installing or setting sync folder.


## Others

# General policies
## Hours
One of the benefits of a career in academic research is that it is typically more flexible than other kinds of jobs. However, you should still treat it like a job. If you are employed for 40 hours a week, you should be working 40 hours a week. This applies to lab staff members (the lab manager and other research assistants) and postdocs. You are not required to work over-time. For graduate students, you are recognized with other demands on your time like classes and TA-ing but still expect to see you in lab, doing research, often. Lab staff members are expected to keep regular office hours (e.g., somewhere in the ballpark of 8-5). Graduate students and postdocs have more flexibility. 

### Office hours
Dr. Leary is generally in office from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays. You can send her an email if you cannot find her.

## Meetings
### Weekly lab meetings
Weekly lab meetings will be focused on project presentations and going over new data or methods. The weekly lab meeting will take place on Missouri Orthopaedic Institute in room 4204 on 3:45pm every Tuesday, and meetings usually last about 1 to 1.5 hours. If the location or time changes, Ms. Kyeong and Dr. Leary will email you in advance. If at the end of meeting, we need more time to discuss something, we will either take a break before continuing or schedule another meeting. Lab meeting agendas and notes will be maintained in the `lab meetings` folder on Box. All lab members are expected to attend the weekly lab meeting. 

### Individual meetings

## Deadlines
It is essential to keep works and deadlines organized. When it comes to deadlines, tell your collaborators **as soon as you know when a deadline is**, and make sure they are aware of it the closer it gets. Don’t be afraid to bug them about it.

Dr. Leary will expect 2 notices for reading/ commenting on abstracts, papers, and manuscripts, 2 weeks for filling out paperwork, etc, and 2 notices for letters of recommendation. If you want feedback on research and teaching statements, or other work that requires multiple back-and-forth interactions between you and Dr. Leary before a hard deadline, give her as much time as you can.
## Presentations
It is therefore highly encouraged that you seek out opportunities to present your research, whether it is at departmental talk series and events, to other labs at conferences, or to the general public. If you are going to give a presentation (a poster or a talk), be prepared to give a practice presentation to the lab at least one week ahead of time (two weeks or more are advisable for conference presentations, and many weeks ahead of time are advisable for job talks, which require much refining).  Practice talks will help you feel comfortable with your presentation, and will also allow you to get feedback from the lab and implement those changes well in advance of your real presentation.

Templates for posters are available, and those are highly recommended, particularly for orthopaedic focused conference. Some general rules for posters should be followed: minimize text as much as possible (if you wrote a paragraph, you’re doing it wrong), make figures and text large and easy to see at a distance, label your axes, and make sure different colors are easily discriminable. 
## Recommendation letters
Letters of recommendation are one of the many benefits of working in a research lab. You can count on Dr. Leary to write a letter if you have spent at least 6 months in the lab. (It’s hard to really know someone if they have only been around for a few months.) Exceptions can be made for shorter-term lab members in special circumstances (e.g., new graduate students or postdocs applying for fellowships). 

To request a letter of recommendation, please adhere to the deadline requirements described above, your current CV and any relevant instructions for the contents of the letter. Your specific aims or a short summary are required if you are applying for a grant. In some but not all cases, you may be asked to draft a letter, which will be revised to be consistent with evaluation. This will ensure that the letter contains all the information you need, and that it is submitted on time.

## Data management
### Storing active datasets (need to complete)
In general, data will be stored in one of three places:
- Your assigned box folder
- consent forms, keys to subject IDs (identifiable data ok) 


### Data organization
Your project folders should typically look something like this:
- `ProjectName/Data`
  - contains a folder for raw data - always keep a copy of the raw (i.e., unprocessed) data & keep it separate from the copy that you're using in your pipeline
  - processed data used in following steps – should be labeled clearly
  - this folder also contains a file documenting demographic & other summary info
- `ProjectName/Results`
 - contains folders or files of each type of results, e.g. report, summary
- `ProjectName/Program`
 - contains folders for code
- `ProjectName/Output`
 - contains the outputs of program
You are encouraged to use an organization scheme like this one. When you archive the dataset, you will be required to format it like this (or something similarly transparent in its organization), so might as well start that way. 

### Archiving inactive datasets
Before you leave the lab, you will be required to document and archive any dataset that you have collected. The dataset will be reviewed before you leave. Please move the data to Box folders, and make sure annotated codes are included and will run data. 
### Data sharing
Not only is data-sharing the right thing to do, we are actually required to do so for any dataset that was funded by the NIH. We will make these datasets publicly available within a year of publishing the first paper from the dataset. The final datasets must be extended in .csv format with data dictionary. You should also be prepared to share any scripts that you used in your published processing & analysis pipeline. Currently, the best option for sharing smaller datasets seems to be the Open Science Framework, the best option for sharing MRI datasets is OpenFMRI. You should always ask Dr, Leary before posting or sharing any data.

# Funding

## Allocation of expenses
I will oversee all aspects of the financial management of our funding sources. However, it is important to
me to be transparent about where research money comes from and how it's spent. I have included some notes below but please do not hesitate to ask if you want to know more details.
* MOI/TLRO: These funds are flexible in that they can be used for any justifiable purpose.
* NIH: NIH funds are more restricted than start-up funds and because they expire more quickly, we should use them whenever allowable and save start-up funds for other purposes.
* DoD: Department of Defense (DoD) funds are restricted to these projects only. 
* RDC-US Census Bureau: These funds are available for the NHIS and MEPS projects (and associated costs) only.
* Richard Wallace Faculty Incentive Grant: These funds are for undergraduate research and for the OCA ankle & hip projects only. 
* Other funds: Sometimes the lab receives small amounts of unrestricted funds from the
university; these can be spent in the same way as start-up.

## NIH funding notes
 All research funded by the NIH *must* acknowledge the grant number upon publication. This is essential for documenting that we are turning their money into research findings. We must also submit a yearly progress report describing what we have accomplished. Lab members involved in the research will be asked to contribute to the progress report.
 
## Other funding notes
All research funded by the NIH and DoD must acknowledge the grant number upon publication. This is essential for documenting that we are turning their money into research findings. We must also submit a yearly progress report describing what we have accomplished. Lab members involved in the research will be asked to contribute to the progress report.
Research funded by other grants (e.g., RDC-US Census Bureau) must also acknowledge the source of funding and provide a statement which the RDC or whatever other funding source provides.


# Undergraduate research 
Undergraduate research assistants play an important role in our lab, and we have a few opportunities for them to earn money or credit for their contributions. Because these opportunities require a certain degree of commitment from both the student and the lab, we generally reserve them for students who have already spent at least one semester volunteering in lab. If this policy would prevent you from being able to work in lab, please talk to Dr. Leary or the lab manager because we want all students to be able to pursue their research interests. In addition to volunteering in lab, other research opportunities includes data collection.

5. Name the report: (your name and the dates for the week). For example, Linlin Zhang: Oct 21- Oct 27.

6. Use advanced logic, change the date range and name. For example, “[date]>=20180611 and [date]<=20180617 and [name]=12” will filter all the records for the number 12 person on the name list (Linlin Zhang) from 20180611 to 20180617.

7. Save Report.

8. View report, and take a screenshot to email to Ms. Kyeong and Dr. Leary.


## Basic Data Management

All data must be checked for validity, reasonability, and formatting. Sometimes missing data are denoted by “.”, “_”, “NA”, “NaN”, “-99” or “9999”. Or sometimes values are incorrect, for example, if you have a negative weight or weigh 9999lbs. If you do not check, these can be included in calculated means and other analyses. These may need to be re-coded – this is fine as long as this is documented in the report. 

All statistical assumptions must be met prior to analysis. If assumptions are not met, investigate other approaches (e.g. non-parametric) or by combining categories for small cell counts. 

## Time Tracking Procedures

Time tracking is required for each member since it can help us to manage your work and make a long-term plan for both of you and our projects. Also, time tracking helps us to assign you work effectively. REDCap is used to track your work hours every week. Through REDCap system, you need to submit some specific information:
*	The record ID
*	Data worked
*	Your name
*	The project you worked
*	Number of hours you worked for each project
*	Type of your work
*	Details of your work

The time sheet you reported should be from Sunday to Saturday of last week. When finishing with time tracking, please email the screenshot of your time sheet to Ms. Kyeong and Dr. Leary.
Then please make sure all the work you did have been uploaded to your BOX folder in order, and the time tracking procedures should be done by the end of Sunday.


## Dataset Guidelines

### NIS

* Background on Data

The National Inpatient Sample (NIS) is part of the family of databases and software tools developed for the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). The NIS is the largest all-payer inpatient care database in the United States, containing data on more than seven million hospital stays. Its large sample size is ideal for developing national and regional estimates, and it enables analyses of rare conditions, uncommon treatments, and special populations. Some more information can be found here. 

* Typical Analyses Run

Typically, we aim to determine the risk factors that would related to operative features (e.g., major complication) after some specific operations (e.g., central cord syndrome operations). A preliminary study of effect of variable RACE (non-white, white) was conducted by calculating the descriptive statistics and odds ratios for operative features and patient characteristics. Continuous variables were compared between white and non-white races using two-sample t-tests. Discrete variables were studied thought chi-square tests to determine their association. After the preliminary study, the effect of specific operative features (e.g., major complication) was conducted as the same way. Then a step-wise multivariate logistic regression model was used to determine multivariate relationships with the specific operative feature (e.g., major complication). Then, ROC curve and confusion matrix were applied to analyze the cut-off points of the logistic model. Therefore, the risk factors were determined by comparing the difference of univariate and multivariate analysis.


### NHIS

* Background on Data

The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) has monitored the health of the nation since 1957. NHIS data on a broad range of health topics are collected through personal household interviews. For over 50 years, the U.S. Census Bureau has been the data collection agent for the National Health Interview Survey. Survey results have been instrumental in providing data to track health status, health care access, and progress toward achieving national health objectives. Some more information can be found here.

* Typical Analyses Run

Analysis of NHIS data are similar with NIS data. The example report shown on the following section indicates the analyzing process. The purpose is to determine the risk factors that would related to operative features (e.g., readmission) after some specific operations (e.g., cervical spine fusion surgery). Two sample t-test and chi-square test were used to analysis continuous and discrete variables to determine their association with operative features of interest. Then a step-wise multivariate logistic regression model was used to determine multivariate relationship with operative features of interest. As same with NIS data analysis, ROC curve and confusion matrix were used to decide the cut-off points. Consequently, the risk factors were determined by comparing result of univariate and multivariate analysis.


### MEPS

* Background on Data

The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) is a set of large-scale surveys of families and individuals, their medical providers, and employers across the United States. MEPS is the most complete source of data on the cost and use of health care and health insurance coverage.
