# Introduction
Welcome to the Leary – Ortho Biostats Lab manual. This manual was inspired by other similar works, and borrows heavily from them (e.g., [this one](https://github.com/alylab/labmanual) and [this one](https://github.com/memobc/memolab-manual)). It is intended to represent my vision for how the lab should function and to complement existing University of Missouri policies (which take precedence). We hope you will learn a lot about clinical statistics, developing new skills (coding, analyzing data, writing and giving talks), making new friends and having a great deal of fun throughout the whole process.

This work is licensed under a CC Attribution 4.0 license. We expect that more information will be added and some sections will be revised as the lab grows and develops. If you have any comments or suggestions regarding the contents of this manual, please tell Dr. Leary (leary@health.missouri.edu).

# Lab member expectations and responsibilities
## Everyone
### Big picture
- Do work that you are proud of. 
- Don’t rush your work. Double-check your work and ask others to look at your code or data if you need help or something looks off. 
- Tell your collaborators if you do make a mistake (if they have already seen the results). We admit our mistakes, and then we correct them and move on.
- No academic misconduct. It is never ok to plagiarize, tamper with data, make up data, omit data, or fudge results in any way.
- Be supportive of your lab mates. Share your knowledge and help them out if they need help.
- Work independently when you can, ask for help when you need it.
- Respect each other’s strengths, weaknesses, differences and beliefs.
- Take personal time/ vacation when you need it and cultivate a life outside of the lab. Respect that other lab members also have a life outside of lab.
- Communicate openly and respectfully with other members of the lab. Dr. Leary would rather know more that she needs to know than less. 
- If there is any tension or hostility in the lab, something has to be done about it immediately. If you don’t feel comfortable confronting the person in question, tell Dr. Leary.

### Small picture
- Do not come into the lab if you are sick. Stay home and get healthy, and don't risk getting others sick.
- Notify Ms. Kyeong or Dr. Leary if you will be out, either due to illness or vacation. You need to send an email to Dr. Leary and cc Stacee Clawson and Gigi Harrison. If you are sick and you had experiments or meetings scheduled that day, notify your participants or collaborators and reschedule.
- You aren’t expected to come into lab on weekends and holidays, and you aren’t expected to stay late at night. You are expected to get your work done (whatever time of day you like to do it).
- Show up to your meetings, classes, and exams – just show up for your commitments, and work the hours you need to work to get stuff done.
- Lock the doors if no one else is around, even if you're stepping out for a minute.
- Keep your area tidy. Eating at your desk is fine, but clean up food waste, crumbs, spills. Put equipment back where you found it. Keep common areas uncluttered.
- MOI has a specific dress code, you can check the details at [MOI dress code](#MOI-dress-code). 
- Two trainings (HCUP and IRB) are necessity to be conducted before working. Find detail [here](#Training).

- Be on time. Be on time for your meetings: respect that others have packed days and everyone’s time is valuable.

## Dr. Leary – Principal Investigator
All of the [above](#everyone), plus you can expect her to:
- Maintain a vision of where the lab is going
- Provide the funding necessary to keep the lab going
- Be available in person and via e-mail on a regular basis, including regular meetings to discuss your research (and anything else you’d like to discuss)
- Give you my perspective on academia and issues related to professional development
- Support your career development by introducing you to other researchers in the field, writing recommendation letters for you, providing you with opportunities to attend conferences when possible, and promoting your work in talks
- Care about you as a person and not just a scientist

## Postdocs
All of the above, plus you will be expected to:
- Develop your own independent line of research
- Mentor undergraduate and graduate students on their research projects, when asked or when appropriate
- Apply for external funding.
- Apply for jobs (academic or industry) as soon as you are "ready" and/or by the end of beginning of your second year as a postdoc.
- If you are planning to pursue a non-academic career, treat your postdoctoral research as seriously as you might if you were pursuing an academic career. We can discuss ways of making sure that you are getting the training you need, while still doing excellent research.
- Remind the PI that different scientific opinions can co-exist in the same lab!

## Graduate students (PhD)
All of the above, plus you will be expected to:
- Develop a line of dissertation research. Ideally, your dissertation research will consist of at least 3 experiments that can be packaged into one thesis document.
- Apply for external funding. If nothing else, this is an extremely valuable experience.
- Do some soul-searching as to what type of career you want to pursue, e.g., academic jobs that are research-focused or teaching-focused, non-academic jobs like data science or science writing. We can brainstorm ways of making sure you are getting the training that you need.
- Work with a team of undergraduate students or graduate students more junior than you. This will speed up data collection and give you some experience with managing and mentoring a team.
- Stay up-to-date (and keep up-to-date) on any deadlines that you need to meet to fulfill departmental requirements. This is your responsibility not the PI’s.

## Lab managers
All of the above, plus you will be expected to:
- Maintain the lab IRB protocols and paperwork (e.g., archiving consent forms).
- Oversee the hiring, scheduling, and training of undergraduate and master graduate level research assistants.
- Maintain the lab website.
- Assist other lab members with data collection or analysis (typically you will be assigned to particular projects).
-Maintain databases and grant data requests.
- Help to maintain an atmosphere of professionalism within the lab.
- Work on your own research project.

## Other full-time staff
All of the above, plus you will be expected to:
- Work on your own research project.
- Assist other lab members with data collection or analysis (typically you will be assigned to particular projects).
- Help to maintain an atmosphere of professionalism within the lab.
- Provide extra support to the lab manager and PI.

## Undergraduate students
All of the above, plus you will be expected to:
- Assist other lab members with data collection or analysis (typically you will be assigned to particular projects).
- Work with the lab manager and/or your research mentor to determine your weekly schedule. If you are not able to come in during your normal scheduled time, you must let the lab manager or research mentor know.
- Provide extra support to the lab manager (this may include filing paperwork). If you are in lab and do not have a task to do, you should ask the lab manager or your supervisor whether there is anything you can help out with.
- For more information about undergraduate research positions, refer to the Undergraduate Research section below.

# Code of conduct
## General
Many topics were covered already in the Lab member expectations & responsibilities section.

**In addition:**

Confidentiality Policy
We expect all the lab members to exercise reasonable care in the disclosure, use and management of restricted information about patients, patient care, personnel, students and the fiscal affairs of University of Missouri Health. 

Protected Health Information (PHI)
Patient information is confidential. This includes all patient information, whether in electronic, audio, photo, video or paper form. We expect all lab members to protect and preserve this confidentiality. 

MU Health operates under the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rules and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act. The HIPAA Security Rules require MU Health and our business associates to use administrative, physical and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic protected health information (PHI). 

We do not access, obtain, disclose or discuss PHI without written authorization from patients or their legal representatives, unless necessary for treatment, payment or health care operations, or required by law. We also follow the “Minimum Necessary Rule” which means employees, faculty and staff have the right to access only the patient information necessary to perform our respective jobs. If you have questions regarding access to PHI, please contact the System Privacy Officer at (573) 882-3293. 

Data Security
We must exercise reasonable care in the disclosure, transmission, access, use and management of confidential information about patients, patient care, personnel, students and proprietary business affairs of University of Missouri Health. 
As stated in the University of Missouri Acceptable Use Policy, electronic information on MU Health networks or equipment, including, but not limited to, electronic mail and personal information, is subject to examination when: 
•	It is necessary to maintain or improve the functioning of our computing resources. 
•	There is suspicion of misconduct under MU Health policies or suspicion of violation of federal or state law. 
•	It is necessary to comply with or verify compliance with federal or state law. 

Protecting confidential information is a priority within our health care system: 
•	Do NOT access patient information unless you need the information to do your job. Inappropriate access to patient information will lead to disciplinary action. 
•	You are to access only the minimum information necessary to accomplish your assigned job duties. This includes all information in paper and electronic form. 
•	Only discuss patient information with authorized personnel and in a private location where unauthorized persons cannot overhear even if you are not using patient names. 
•	Do NOT give information about patients or staff to anyone over the phone.
•	Shred or place confidential information in receptacles specifically used for confidential waste disposal. Never put confidential waste in recycle bins or the regular trash. 
•	The Access and Confidentiality Agreement must be read and signed by all instructors and all lab members. 
Some more information about MU health confidentiality can be found here.


Lab Notebook Policy
Upon your involvement in research at the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, you will be provided a notebook to aid in your work. Research or lab notebooks are an essential part of doing scientific research. The purpose of this notebook is to have an organized location for you to record and store notes and protocols about the research projects you are involved in through the department. This will help you to keep track of your work and allow you and others to review the steps taken during your analyses.

Expectations
This notebook:
•	should be labeled with your name and contact information,
•	should be brought to every meeting with Dr. Leary/Ms Kyeong,
•	should be legible and kept in good condition,
•	should contain notes from meetings and a detailed account of the statistical analyses you perform,
•	should be organized and detailed enough for someone else to read and understand what you did,
•	should not contain notes for other courses or projects outside of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery.

Security
All notebook holders should consider the sensitivity of the information that might be contained within the notebook in order to minimize dissemination of unauthorized information. Due to the sensitive nature of the data that you will be working with, the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery retains the right to confiscate this notebook anytime during or after your involvement with any affiliated research projects. 


Schedule Notification
For all lab members, your particular work of last week and work schedule for the following week will be discussed and assigned on weekly meeting. 
The lab meeting is obligatory for each member. If you will be absent for some particular reason for the lab meeting, earlier notification needs to be made to Dr. Leary and Ms. Kyeong. For students, the schoolwork is priority, however you need to communicate with your supervisors when your schoolwork conflicts with Lab work and it is necessary to reduce work hours. Any event for personal reason needs to be notified in advance to avoid dispensable planning and scheduling. 

All members of the lab, along with visitors, are expected to agree with the following code of conduct. We will enforce this code as needed. We expect cooperation from all members to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody. Please also see the University of Missouri NONDISCRIMINATION POLICY.

The lab is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of lab members in any form. Sexual language and imagery are generally not appropriate for any lab venue, including lab meetings, presentations, or discussions. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Dr. Leary immediately. If Dr. Leary is the cause of your concern, then please reach out to Ms. Stacee Clawson, Dr. James Cook or another trusted departmental member who can assist.

We expect members to follow these guidelines at any lab-related event or activity.

## Scientific integrity
### Reproducible research
Reproducible research is research that can be exactly reproduced given the *same* raw data. It is an *essential* part of science, and an expectation for all projects in the lab. Reproducibility is related to replicability, which refers to whether your results can be obtained again with a *different* data set. We expect that all of our research will be replicable, or, at least reproducible.

For results to be reproducible, it requires that you are organized and possess sufficient foresight to document each step of your research process. There are two main things you can do to improve the reproducibility of your research:
- Extensive note-taking. You will need extensive notes on each step of your analysis pipeline, explaining how you did things every step of the way (and the order that you did things), from any pre-processing of the data, to running models, to statistical tests. Your code should also be commented, and commented clearly. Comment your code so that every step is understandable by an outsider. 
- Programming workflows with version control. It is highly encouraged that you use some form of version control (e.g., Git in combination with GitHub) to keep track of what code changes you made and when you made them, as well as sharing code with others.

### Authorship
We will follow NIH guidelines with respect to authorship

>"Authorship credit should reflect the individual's contribution to the study. An author is considered anyone involved with initial research design, data collection and analysis, manuscript drafting, and final approval. However, the following do not necessarily qualify for authorship: providing funding or resources, mentorship, or contributing research but not helping with the publication itself. The primary author assumes responsibility for the publication, making sure that the data are accurate, that all deserving authors have been credited, that all authors have given their approval to the final draft; and handles responses to inquiries after the manuscript is published."

Authorship will be discussed prior to the beginning of a new project, so that expectations are clearly defined. However, changes to authorship may occur over the course of a project if a new person becomes involved or if someone is not fulfilling their planned role. In general, graduate students and postdocs will be first authors on publications on which they are the primary lead, and Dr. Leary will be the last author.

#### Old projects
If a student or post-doc collects a dataset but does not completely analyze it or write it up within 3 years after the end of data collection, Dr. Leary will re-assign the project (if appropriate) to another person to expedite publication. If a student or post-doc voluntarily relinquishes their rights to the project prior to the 3-year window, Dr. Leary will also re-assign the project to another individual. This policy is here to prevent data (especially expensive data, e.g., fMRI) from remaining unpublished, but is meant to give priority to the person who collected the data initially.
## Human subjects research
Adherence to approved IRB protocols is *essential*, and non-adherence can lead to severe consequences for the entire lab. **All lab members must read and comply with the IRB consent form and research summary for any project that they are working on.** If you are not on the IRB, you cannot look at the data, analyze the data, or be in any way involved with the project. 

Lab members must also complete the CITI training and save their certificate. To be added to an existing IRB, talk to the lab manager and present them with your CITI certificate before you can work with human subjects. If there are any questions about the protocols, or if you're not sure whether we have IRB approval to run your study, please ask the lab manager or Dr. Leary for clarification. If necessary, the lab manager can file an amendment to an existing protocol or create a new protocol.

If you encounter any problems in the course of doing research that results in a negative outcome for the participant (e.g., if a participant becomes ill or upset, if there is an accident with the equipment, if there is a breach of confidentiality, etc), you should immediately seek assistance from Dr. Leary or the lab manager. If Dr. Leary is not around, you must notify Dr. Leary and the lab manager *within 24 hours*, preferably as soon as possible. In some cases, we may need to report this information to the IRB and/or our funding agencies.

# General policies
## Hours
One of the benefits of a career in academic research is that it is typically more flexible than other kinds of jobs. However, you should still treat it like a job. If you are employed for 40 hours a week, you should be working 40 hours a week. This applies to lab staff members (the lab manager and other research assistants) and postdocs. You are not required to work over-time. For graduate students, you are recognized with other demands on your time like classes and TA-ing but still expect to see you in lab, doing research, often. Lab staff members are expected to keep regular office hours (e.g., somewhere in the ballpark of 8-5). Graduate students and postdocs have more flexibility. 

### Office hours
Dr. Leary is generally in office from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays. You can send her an email if you cannot find her.

## Meetings
### Weekly lab meetings
Weekly lab meetings will be focused on project presentations and going over new data or methods. Lab meetings usually last about 1 to 1.5 hours. If at the end of meeting, we need more time to discuss something, we will either take a break before continuing or schedule another meeting. Lab meeting agendas and notes will be maintained in the `lab meetings` folder on Box. All lab members are expected to attend the weekly lab meeting. 
### Individual meetings

## Deadlines
It is essential to keep works and deadlines organized. When it comes to deadlines, tell your collaborators **as soon as you know when a deadline is**, and make sure they are aware of it the closer it gets. Don’t be afraid to bug them about it.

Dr. Leary will expect 2 notices for reading/ commenting on abstracts, papers, and manuscripts, 2 weeks for filling out paperwork, etc, and 2 notices for letters of recommendation. If you want feedback on research and teaching statements, or other work that requires multiple back-and-forth interactions between you and Dr. Leary before a hard deadline, give her as much time as you can.
## Presentations
It is therefore highly encouraged that you seek out opportunities to present your research, whether it is at departmental talk series and events, to other labs at conferences, or to the general public. If you are going to give a presentation (a poster or a talk), be prepared to give a practice presentation to the lab at least one week ahead of time (two weeks or more are advisable for conference presentations, and many weeks ahead of time are advisable for job talks, which require much refining).  Practice talks will help you feel comfortable with your presentation, and will also allow you to get feedback from the lab and implement those changes well in advance of your real presentation.

Templates for posters are available, and those are highly recommended, particularly for orthopaedic focused conference. Some general rules for posters should be followed: minimize text as much as possible (if you wrote a paragraph, you’re doing it wrong), make figures and text large and easy to see at a distance, label your axes, and make sure different colors are easily discriminable. 
## Recommendation letters
Letters of recommendation are one of the many benefits of working in a research lab. You can count on Dr. Leary to write a letter if you have spent at least 6 months in the lab. (It’s hard to really know someone if they have only been around for a few months.) Exceptions can be made for shorter-term lab members in special circumstances (e.g., new graduate students or postdocs applying for fellowships). 

To request a letter of recommendation, please adhere to the deadline requirements described above, your current CV and any relevant instructions for the contents of the letter. Your specific aims or a short summary are required if you are applying for a grant. In some but not all cases, you may be asked to draft a letter, which will be revised to be consistent with evaluation. This will ensure that the letter contains all the information you need, and that it is submitted on time.

## Data management
### Storing active datasets (need to complete)
In general, data will be stored in one of three places:
- Your assigned box folder
- consent forms, keys to subject IDs (identifiable data ok) 


### Data organization
Your project folders should typically look something like this:
- `ProjectName/Data`
  - contains a folder for raw data - always keep a copy of the raw (i.e., unprocessed) data & keep it separate from the copy that you're using in your pipeline
  - processed data used in following steps – should be labeled clearly
  - this folder also contains a file documenting demographic & other summary info
- `ProjectName/Results`
 - contains folders or files of each type of results, e.g. report, summary
- `ProjectName/Program`
 - contains folders for code
- `ProjectName/Output`
 - contains the outputs of program
You are encouraged to use an organization scheme like this one. When you archive the dataset, you will be required to format it like this (or something similarly transparent in its organization), so might as well start that way. 

### Archiving inactive datasets
Before you leave the lab, you will be required to document and archive any dataset that you have collected. The dataset will be reviewed before you leave. Please move the data to Box folders, and make sure annotated codes are included and will run data. 
### Data sharing
Not only is data-sharing the right thing to do, we are actually required to do so for any dataset that was funded by the NIH. We will make these datasets publicly available within a year of publishing the first paper from the dataset. The final datasets must be extended in .csv format with data dictionary. You should also be prepared to share any scripts that you used in your published processing & analysis pipeline. Currently, the best option for sharing smaller datasets seems to be the Open Science Framework, the best option for sharing MRI datasets is OpenFMRI. You should always ask Dr, Leary before posting or sharing any data.

# Funding

## Allocation of expenses

## NIH funding notes
 All research funded by the NIH *must* acknowledge the grant number upon publication. This is essential for documenting that we are turning their money into research findings. We must also submit a yearly progress report describing what we have accomplished. Lab members involved in the research will be asked to contribute to the progress report.

# Undergraduate research 
Undergraduate research assistants play an important role in our lab, and we have a few opportunities for them to earn money or credit for their contributions. Because these opportunities require a certain degree of commitment from both the student and the lab, we generally reserve them for students who have already spent at least one semester volunteering in lab. If this policy would prevent you from being able to work in lab, please talk to Dr. Leary or the lab manager because we want all students to be able to pursue their research interests. In addition to volunteering in lab, other research opportunities includes data collection.
 








Dataset Guidelines

NIS

Background on Data
The National Inpatient Sample (NIS) is part of the family of databases and software tools developed for the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). The NIS is the largest all-payer inpatient care database in the United States, containing data on more than seven million hospital stays. Its large sample size is ideal for developing national and regional estimates, and it enables analyses of rare conditions, uncommon treatments, and special populations. Some more information can be found here. 

Typical Analyses Run
Typically, we aim to determine the risk factors that would related to operative features (e.g., major complication) after some specific operations (e.g., central cord syndrome operations). A preliminary study of effect of variable RACE (non-white, white) was conducted by calculating the descriptive statistics and odds ratios for operative features and patient characteristics. Continuous variables were compared between white and non-white races using two-sample t-tests. Discrete variables were studied thought chi-square tests to determine their association. After the preliminary study, the effect of specific operative features (e.g., major complication) was conducted as the same way. Then a step-wise multivariate logistic regression model was used to determine multivariate relationships with the specific operative feature (e.g., major complication). Then, ROC curve and confusion matrix were applied to analyze the cut-off points of the logistic model. Therefore, the risk factors were determined by comparing the difference of univariate and multivariate analysis.

Example Report
The example report shows predictors of major complication after central cord syndrome operation.

Predictors of Major Complication After Central Cord Syndrome Operation

Objective. The aim of this study is to determine the risk factors that would related to the major complication after central cord syndrome operations.
Summary of Background Data. Data were taken from the 2014 HCUP National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database. Risk factors in patient demographics as well as operative features were studied through t-test and chi-square test to determine their association with race and major complications. A step-wise multivariate logistic regression model was used to determine multivariate relationships with major complication.
Result. Elder patients discharged to a location that was not home, with a greater length of stay, and greater number of chronic conditions are more likely to have major complication after central cord syndrome operations.
1.	Materials and Methods
Data were collected from 2014 NSQIP database. There are 946 observations and 178 variables in the data set. Ten variables, including sex, age (both continuous and in age ranges),  length of stay (LOS), number of chronic conditions (NCHRONIC), Insurance Status (Primarypayer), Urban or Rural Status for patient location (PL_NCHS), median household income for patient location zip code (ZIPINC_QRTL), geographic region in the US (HOSP_DIVISION), Discharge destination (home or not home), and RACE (white and non-white) are of interest to determine if they would be the predictors of the occurrence of major complication.  Table1 shows several important variables which are self-created according to other available information in the original data set. Appendix 1 shows relevant CPT code results by race. 

As a preliminary study of effect of variable RACE (non-white, white), odds ratios were calculated for operative features and patient characteristics (Table 2). Continuous variables were compared between white and non-white races using two-sample t-tests.  There are significant associations between white and non-white race with respect to Sex, AGE (both as continuous and age groups), length of stay (LOS), number of chronic conditions (NCHRONIC), Insurance Status (Primarypayer), Urban or Rural Status for patient location (PL_NCHS), median household income for patient location zip code (ZIPINC_QRTL), and geographic region in the US (HOSP_DIVISION). Take insurance status for example.  The odds of non-whites having Medicaid as their primary payer is 2.1921 times the odds of whites.  Odds denoted by “1” in Table 2 denote the category used for comparison or the “baseline” group. Continuous variables were compared between those with major complication and those without using a two-sample t-test. 
Table 1 Variables recoding notes
Variables	Notes
RACE	coded by collapsing original RACE’s 5 non-white categories to be one  
Discharge destination	coded by dividing DISPUNIFORM into 2 groups “home” and “not home”
primary payer	coded by collapsing Pay1’s “Self-pay” and “No charge” to be “uninsured”
complication	coded based on other 30 diagnoses variables describe specific symptom of complication
reoperation	coded based on other 30 diagnoses variables describe specific reoperations
Major complication	created based on complication, reoperation and DIED
2.	Univariate Analysis
Table 3 shows the odds ratios of a different risk factors and their 95% confidence intervals. 
Take discharge destination as an example.  The odds of major complication after cervical fusion operations is 3.1148 times greater for those patients discharged to somewhere other than home compared to those discharged home. Odds denoted by “1” in Table 3 denote the category used for comparison or the “baseline” group. Continuous variables were compared between those with major complication and those without using a two-sample t-test. Appendix 2 shows relevant diagnostic codes by major complication.
3.	Multivariate Analysis
A stepwise multivariate logistic regression was conducted on the data set with 945 non-missing observations and Table 4 shows the model results. A final model was chosen based on AIC value.  Based on 0.05 significance level, AGE (continuous), length of stay (LOS), number of chronic conditions (NCHRONIC), and Discharge destination (home, not home) are significant predictors of major complications. Figure 1 shows the ROC of the final model and the area under the curve (AUC) is 0.7968 with a 95% confidence interval [0.7674, 0.8263].  
The selection of cut-offs does not influence the modeling procedure (coefficients estimations, odds ratios and other statistics, Table 4) and resulting predicted probabilities. However, the misclassification rate and the power of the prediction are highly related to the cut-off setting used since these are used to predict an observation to be "1" or "0" (using the predicted probability). According to confusion table (Table 5), if the commonly used 0.5 is used as the prediction cut-off, the type I error will be extremely small but the power is small as well. But if the Youden’s Index value is used as the cut-off, this maximizes the sum of sensitivity and specificity, the power increases to 0.7027 while the type I error also increases dramatically. There is always a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity. Youden’s index is recommended here since it’s a cut-off which equally weights sensitivity and specificity.

4.	Results and Discussion
Table 6 shows the comparison between univariate analysis and multivariate analysis for major complication. It seems that the univariate results identified more variables as risk factors for major complication than with multivariate relationships through the stepwise logistic regression. But they give consistent overall conclusions, [i.e., elder patients, discharged to a place other than home, with greater length of stay, and more chronic conditions, are more likely to have major complications after central cord syndrome operations.]

NHIS

Background on Data
The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) has monitored the health of the nation since 1957. NHIS data on a broad range of health topics are collected through personal household interviews. For over 50 years, the U.S. Census Bureau has been the data collection agent for the National Health Interview Survey. Survey results have been instrumental in providing data to track health status, health care access, and progress toward achieving national health objectives. Some more information can be found here.

Typical Analyses Run
Analysis of NHIS data are similar with NIS data. The example report shown on the following section indicates the analyzing process. The purpose is to determine the risk factors that would related to operative features (e.g., readmission) after some specific operations (e.g., cervical spine fusion surgery). Two sample t-test and chi-square test were used to analysis continuous and discrete variables to determine their association with operative features of interest. Then a step-wise multivariate logistic regression model was used to determine multivariate relationship with operative features of interest. As same with NIS data analysis, ROC curve and confusion matrix were used to decide the cut-off points. Consequently, the risk factors were determined by comparing result of univariate and multivariate analysis.

Example Report
The example report reveals the risk factors of readmission after taking cervical spine fusion surgery.

Retrospective MU Cervical Spine Fusion Study

Objective. The aim of this study is to determine the risk factors that would be related to different outcomes after cervical spine fusion surgery.
Summary of Background Data. Risk factors in patient demographics as well as operative features are studied through chi-square tests, t-tests, and multivariate logistic regression to determine their association with outcomes of interest.
Result. The risk factors for readmission that both univariate analyses and multivariate analyses identified is variables implant loosing, pseduoarthrosis, and adjacent segment disease.
1.	Materials and Methods
Data were retrospectively collected from EMRs. There are 256 observations.
As a preliminary study of effect of variable RACE, a summary of all demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical variables were compared using chi-square tests for association and the associated odds ratios were calculated, as Table 1 shows. There are significant associations between white and non-white race with respect to wound complication - infection. Take it for example, the odds ratio of “Non-white” to “White” is 13.1111, and the p-value is less than 0.05, which means the non-white patients have higher odds of Wound complication - infection compared to white patients.

2.	Univariate Analysis
Univariate analyses of readmission risk factors were performed through chi-square tests and the associated odds ratio was reported. The readmission variable has two measurements, “Yes” and “No”. In addition, a stepwise multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine significant predictors. 
Table 2 shows the odds ratios of a series potential risk factors and their 95% confidence intervals and p-values of the odds ratio tests. Take implant loosening for instance, the odds ratio of “Yes” to “No” is 11.5625, and the p-value is less than 0.05, which means the patients who have implant loosening will have higher odds of a readmission after cervical operations. And it is similar to the factors, complication, pseduoarthrosis, adjacent segment disease, and revision surgeries, which are other risk factors would result in readmission.

3.	Multivariate Analysis
A stepwise multivariate logistic regression was conducted on the data set with 243 observations and Table 3 shows the estimates of coefficients. Readmission was modeled as response, the variables of risk factors were included in the full model and dropped based on VIF value. Stepwise logistic regression was applied, and the final model was chosen by AIC. Based on a 0.05 significance level, implant loosing, adjacent segment disease, and pseduoarthrosis are significant predictors of readmission. Figure 1 shows the ROC of the final model and the AUC is 0.8242 with a 95% confidence interval being [0.7572, 0.8913].

According to confusion table, the misclassification rate and the power the prediction are highly related to the cutoff setting. Because of the definition of variables, the cutoff point of common used and Youden’s Index are 0.5 and 0.2091. To maximize detection of any readmission and minimize type I error, the cutoff point are set as 0.065 and 0.96. For these four cutoff points, the misclassification rates are 0.1564, 0.1811, 0.7160 and 0.2387 respectively.

## Direction and Maps of MOI
Please enter MOI through the North entrance next to the parking garage. Since you will need a badge to get in through the East entrance, don’t enter through the East main entrance.
North entrance directions: follow the red line on the “MOI 4th floor-original wing” map. You will enter on the first floor and go to the right to the Gold Elevators next to the stairs. Take this to the 4th floor and walk straight through the doors ahead of you. There should be one or two people sitting behind the reception desk. They should be able to direct you if you tell them you are looking for room 4204. Otherwise follow the red line on the map down the long hallway. The red line on the map terminates at a door. You will walk through this door and the red line picks up on the “MOI 4th floor-expansion” map. The room is straight ahead on the right past the wall of windows.
The maps of MOI 4th floor are shown below.
 
 
## Training

1. Training for IRB Approval:

Go to [website](http://ecompliance.missouri.edu/login) to set up an eIRB account. Sign in and complete it. After setting up your eIRB account, you will enter the Institutional Review Board Compliance Module in eIRB and under “Prerequisites” you will choose “Take IRB Training” as shown in the figure below. 

Then you will sign into the CITI Program and follow the enclosed IRB course instructions (Make sure you are affiliated with the University of Missouri- Columbia).

Once you have completed the IRB training, you will need to add the GCP training and follow the GCP instructions next to “IRB course instructions”. The page of IRB course instructions and GCP instructions are shown in the figure below.

When you complete it, you need to email the certificate to Vicki/Director. 

2. Training for NIS/HCUP:

NIS/HCUP training is located here: [website](https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/tech_assist/dua.jsp). There are two versions of HCUP training courses, one is a current version, alternative is a text version. You can choose one of them. Stats volunteers will need to fill out and sign data use agreement. Training certificates and data use agreements should be sent or given to Dr. Leary or Ms. Kyeong.


## BOX Folder Setup

Each member will have a BOX folder named by your name. This folder contains all the materials of your projects. 

The projects will have the following folders in each project folder for consistency. You must save each file with the date in the filename using the following format, “yyyymmdd”. For example, if I were saving a report for an ACL project on Aug 10, 2017 it would be saved as “Report_ACLproject_20170810.docx”. It is extremely important that the R code file matches the R workspace file – this is why putting dates in the file names are so important. Never delete old files – they should all have different names (because of the date at the end) and be placed in an “OLD” subfolder, within each project folder 
*	Data – put all Data here, initial data, formatted data, data dictionaries etc. 
*	Programs – put all R code here or any other code. You must save your R code each time you revise it. You must annotate all of your R code. It may be years until you need to re-visit a project (or I may need to later on). Annotate your code! 
*	Output – put all calculated tables, figures, and other output here. You must save your R workspace here. 
*	Reports – put all report drafts here as well as any other reporting documents or data. 

## File Formatting

*	All Word Files must be changed to the English language and all reports must be spell-checked (in English!). 
*	All tables and figures must have a title.
*	All figures must have labels for both the y-axis and the x-axis. These labels should also be formatted for presentation. 


## REDCap Instruction

We use REDCap to track hours and record what you have done weekly.Go to [here](https://medicine.missouri.edu/research/investigator-resources/show-me-portal/show-me-portal-resources)

The process is: Weekly Time Summary<< Add/Edit records<< Create a new report which contains all the records on the past week.

*Starting with a project “Weekly Time Summary”


	* Add/Edit records
	Add a new record and fill all the areas which must be provided. Then save the record. You can add        several records that you worked for the past week.


















* Create a new report
 

*Then, fill out all the areas:
*Name the report: (your name and the dates for the week). For example, Linlin Zhang: Oct 21- Oct 27.
*When editing record, fill some useful areas, for example, 7 useful areas are shown as below:









*Use advanced logic, change the date range and name. For example, “[date]>=20180611 and [date]<=20180617 and [name]=12” will filter all the records for the number 12 person on the name list (Linlin Zhang) from 20180611 to 20180617.
*Save Report
*View report, and take a screenshot to email to Ms. Kyeong and Dr. Leary


## Basic Data Management

All data must be checked for validity, reasonability, and formatting. Sometimes missing data are denoted by “.”, “_”, “NA”, “NaN”, “-99” or “9999”. Or sometimes values are incorrect, for example, if you have a negative weight or weigh 9999lbs. If you do not check, these can be included in calculated means and other analyses. These may need to be re-coded – this is fine as long as this is documented in the report. 

All statistical assumptions must be met prior to analysis. If assumptions are not met, investigate other approaches (e.g. non-parametric) or by combining categories for small cell counts. 

## Time Tracking Procedures

Time tracking is required for each member since it can help us to manage your work and make a long-term plan for both of you and our projects. Also, time tracking helps us to assign you work effectively. REDCap is used to track your work hours every week. Through REDCap system, you need to submit some specific information:
*	The record ID
*	Data worked
*	Your name
*	The project you worked
*	Number of hours you worked for each project
*	Type of your work
*	Details of your work

The time sheet you reported should be from Sunday to Saturday of last week. When finishing with time tracking, please email the screenshot of your time sheet to Ms. Kyeong and Dr. Leary.
Then please make sure all the work you did have been uploaded to your BOX folder in order, and the time tracking procedures should be done by the end of Sunday.
